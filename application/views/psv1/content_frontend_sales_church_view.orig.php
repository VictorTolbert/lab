	<div class="row section-white">
			<p>Through a highly tailored geo-location process Promise Serves uses the serving status of a volunteer, their preferred service role, and the proximity of their location to find the perfect service match between the volunteer and the family being served. This ensures that the volunteer is serving in the role they prefer without a needlessly long commute. Shorter commutes and service role matching make a happy volunteer who is more likely to develop better relationships with the family and more consistently serve that family for a longer period of time. There are currently no RMS / CRM solutions that are designed to meet this multifaceted challenge.</p>

			<p>The primary role of an advocate is to add and support the care communities at your church. The advocate’s administrative burden is complex and time consuming. Beyond simply tracking contact information; advocates need to be able to track volunteer orientation and service status as well as role preferences, team assignments, weekly communications with each team, and one-off need management, fulfillment and follow up.</p>

			<p>Imagine a scenario where you have 50 volunteers at an orientation event and 10 foster families that your church is trying to serve. Without Promise Serves your advocate will need to create a separate spreadsheet outside of your RMS / CRM system to approximate the location of each volunteer to each family. This will require the volunteer to do 500 Google Maps searches and enter the distances into a spreadsheet grid so the best volunteer match can be made. This is in addition to considering the selected the role that the volunteer would be willing to take on the team. Just this one task could take more than 5 hours to complete. Promise Serves accomplishes this same task in seconds and saves your advocate hours of administrative work that could be better used to grow the 	ministry at your church and better support the volunteer teams who are serving the families.</p>

			<p>There are countless administrative tasks that are specific to the Live The Promise model and church based RMS / CRM software packages are ill-equipped to handle the specific needs of this model. By leveraging Promise Serves you will save your volunteers time, give them an easier road to serve more fully, and ultimately better serve the families in your community.</p>

			<p>Promise Serves takes privacy very seriously. We know that dealing with vulnerable family situations requires the highest level of respect for an individual’s privacy and security. We accomplish this by adhering to the industry standard privacy policy and coding standards.</p>

			<p>Being COPPA, CPPA and GDPR compliant, Promise Serves has policies and procedures in place that comply with the most stringent web privacy guidelines on the globe.</p>

			<p>Promise Serves was built from the ground up on a framework that puts privacy at the forefront. From a non-public codebase to 256bit SSL security certificates, we’ve made sure that everything from the code to the server architecture is setup to provide the highest level of data privacy.</p>

			<p>In addition to external privacy Promise Serves offers a suite of privacy options for the volunteers and churches to utilize. All volunteer data is only accessible by the advocates and staff at your church. If you choose to opt out of cross-church teams then even your volunteers names will not be viewable by other churches. This ensures that your volunteer and served family data is completely protected inside of the scope of your church.
