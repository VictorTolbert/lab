<h2>Promise Serves Software</h2>

<p class="lead">IN 2017, WE DEVELOPED PROMISE SERVES, A CHURCH SOFTWARE THAT ALLEVIATES THE BURDENS MANY MINISTRY LEADERS FACE.</p>

<p>At Promise686, we equip churches to implement Family Advocacy Ministries (FAMs) with the goal of caring for vulnerable children. The FAM model, like many other ministries, requires relationship management, admin, and volunteer coordination. We’ve created Promise Serves specifically to handle the custom needs this ministry requires.</p>

<p>This software keeps volunteers engaged, prevents burnout, and ultimately, provides consistent support to families in need.</p>
